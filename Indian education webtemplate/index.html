            <p class="sectionsubtag text-small">Education is the process of facilitating learning, or the acquisition of
                knowledge, skills, values, morals, beliefs, habits, and personal development. Education originated as
                transmission of cultural heritage from one generation to the next. Today, educational goals increasingly
                encompass new ideas such as liberation of learners, critical thinking about presented information,
                skills needed for the modern society, empathy and complex vocational skills.defines three main learning
                settings. Formal education takes place in education and training institutions, is usually structured by
                curricular aims and objectives, and learning is typically guided by a teacher. In most regions, formal
                education is compulsory up to a certain age and commonly divided into educational stages such as
                kindergarten, primary school and secondary school. Nonformal learning occurs as addition or alternative
                to formal education. It may be structured according to educational arrangements, but in a more flexible
                manner, and usually takes place in community-based, workplace-based or civil society-based settings.
                Lastly, informal settings occurs in daily life, in the family, any experience that has a formative
                effect on the way one thinks, feels, or acts may be considered educational, whether unintentional or
                intentional. In practice there is a continuum from the highly formalized to the highly informalized, and
                informal learning can occur in all three settings. For instance, homeschooling can be classified as
                nonformal or informal, depending upon the structure.</p>

            <p class="sectionsubtag text-small"> In Europe ushered in a new age of scientific and intellectual inquiry
                and appreciation of ancient Greek and Roman civilizations. Around 1450, Johannes Gutenberg developed a
                printing press, which allowed works of literature to spread more quickly. The European Age of Empires
                saw European ideas of education in philosophy, religion, arts and sciences spread out across the globe.
                Missionaries and scholars also brought back new ideas from other civilizations – as with the Jesuit
                China missions who played a significant role in the transmission of knowledge, science, and culture
                between China and Europe, translating works from Europe like Euclid's Elements for Chinese scholars and
                the thoughts of Confucius for European audiences. The Enlightenment saw the emergence of a more secular
                educational outlook in Europe. Much of modern traditional Western and Eastern education is based on the
                Prussian education system.

                In most countries today, full-time education, whether at school or otherwise, is compulsory for all
                children up to a certain age. Due to this the proliferation of compulsory education, combined with
                population growth, UNESCO has calculated that in the next 30 years more people will receive formal
                education than in all of human history thus far.

            <p class="sectionsubtag text-small">There are movements for education reforms, such as for improving quality
                and efficiency of education towards relevance in students' lives and efficient problem solving in modern
                or future society at large, or for evidence-based education methodologies. A right to education has been
                recognized by some governments and the United Nations. Global initiatives aim at achieving the
                Sustainable Development Goal 4, which promotes quality education for all.Education began in prehistory,
                as adults trained the young in the knowledge and skills deemed necessary in their society. In
                pre-literate societies, this was achieved orally and through imitation. Story-telling passed knowledge,
                values, and skills from one generation to the next. As cultures began to extend their knowledge beyond
                skills that could be readily learned through imitation, formal education developed. Schools existed in
                Egypt at the time of the Middle Kingdom.
                Primary (or elementary) education consists of the first four to seven years of formal, structured
                education. In general, primary education consists of six to eight years of schooling starting at the age
                of five to seven, although this varies between, and sometimes within, countries. Globally, in 2008,
                around 89% of children aged six to twelve were enrolled in primary education, and this proportion was
                rising.[full citation needed] Under the Education For All programs driven by UNESCO, most countries have
                committed to achieving universal enrollment in primary education by 2015, and in many countries, it is
                compulsory.
                This covers the two ISCED levels, ISCED 2: Lower Secondary Education and ISCED 3: Upper Secondary
                Education.

                In most contemporary educational systems of the world, secondary education comprises the formal
                education that occurs during adolescence. In the United States, Canada, and Australia, primary and
                secondary education together are sometimes referred to as K-12 education, and in New Zealand Year 1–13
                is used. The purpose of secondary education can be to give common knowledge, to ensure literacy, to
                prepare for higher education, or to train directly in a profession. </p>

            <p class="sectionsubtag text-small"> Technology plays an increasingly significant role in improving access to education for people living in impoverished areas and developing countries. However, lack of technological advancement is still causing barriers with regards to quality and access to education in developing countries. Charities like One Laptop per Child are dedicated to providing infrastructures through which the disadvantaged may access educational materials.

                The OLPC foundation, a group out of MIT Media Lab and supported by several major corporations, has a stated mission to develop a $100 laptop for delivering educational software. The laptops were widely available as of 2008. They are sold at cost or given away based on donations.
                
                In Africa, the New Partnership for Africa's Development (NEPAD) has launched an "e-school program" to provide all 600,000 primary and high schools with computer equipment, learning materials and internet access within 10 years An International Development Agency project called nabuur.com, started with the support of former American President Bill Clinton, uses the Internet to allow co-operation by individuals on issues of social development.
                
                India is developing technologies that will bypass land-based telephone and Internet infrastructure to deliver distance learning directly to its students. In 2004, the Indian Space Research Organisation launched EDUSAT, a communications satellite providing access to educational materials that can reach more of the country's population at a greatly reduced cost.

            <p class="sectionsubtag text-small"> A survey of literature of the research into low-cost private schools (LCPS) found that over 5-year period to July 2013, debate around LCPSs to achieving Education for All (EFA) objectives was polarized and finding growing coverage in international policy.[66] The polarization was due to disputes around whether the schools are affordable for the poor, reach disadvantaged groups, provide quality education, support or undermine equality, and are financially sustainable. The report examined the main challenges encountered by development organizations which support LCPSs.[66] Surveys suggest these types of schools are expanding across Africa and Asia. This success is attributed to excess demand. These surveys found concern for:

                Equity: This concern is widely found in the literature, suggesting the growth in low-cost private schooling may be exacerbating or perpetuating already existing inequalities in developing countries, between urban and rural populations, lower- and higher-income families, and between girls and boys. The report findings suggest that girls may be under represented and that LCPS are reaching low-income families in smaller numbers than higher-income families.
